# Donbotti
The Git represents the actual website of the "Faultybot".  
It is a way to kick all banned accounts from your Lichess team. For more information on the Faultybot, please check out the Git there.
[Faultybot](https://github.com/Niffecs/faultybot)

## Installation
To install the web application, simply drag and drop all files and folders to your web server via FTP. That's all you need to do.   
In our example this is the website [donbotti.de](https://www.donbotti.de).

## Usage
You can search for cheaters on the Discord server using the Faultybot. The bot then transfers these to your domain. You can find information on how this all works in the instructions for the Faultybot.
If cheaters are found, you will receive a link to the list. However, if you have only one token, you can enter it here: [Donbotti.de Token](https://www.donbotti.de/index.php?token=none&r=0#id)
